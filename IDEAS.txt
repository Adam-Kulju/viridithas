- increase maxdepth just in case.
- fullwindow on big scores (+30?)
- uci bench extension
- remove `as` casts and unsafe code
- perft divide
- try to reduce attr use, it's ugly.
- make FEN conversion not halt singlethreaded when writing to file. or generally.
- the slow part of deduplication is the file I/O, consider mmap?.
- record percentage of positions where TT move saves movegen - similar for captures when we get staged movegen.
- multipv. put the moves in ThreadData and use ROOT.
- Rust features to watch for: full const generics, const floating-point maths.
- root node eval oracle.
- make the big-piece and other stuff better named
- IID
- put movelists in ThreadData to reuse them.
- make is_legal faster
- check evasions
- filter training positions that are forced.
- fix the horrendous 3-location TT store design in main-search
