ideas for viri
MAJOR: 
- SMP
- tablebases
- docs
- staged move generation (try TT move first at least)
- type-safety overhaul

MINOR:
- update SearchInfo so that only one limit applies at once.
- tune search parameters
- tune move generation (check evasions?)
- learn SPRT
- check out other engine's impls of countermoves and killer moves
- unify pruning into skip_quiets
- replace all the false/true constgen stuff with a proper type.
- alpha pruning
- find a way not to do SEE ordering in qsearch
- increase maxdepth just in case.
- fullwindow on big scores (+30?)
- capture history
- screw with lmp-base-moves
- extend futility further
- dedicated rootsearch function, maybe extend movepicker to handle the root.
- uci bench extension
- remove `as` casts and unsafe code
- use maths for MVVLVA instead of lookups
- things in hashkey: turn, rule50 / 8.
- perft divide
- preorder root nodes with eval, sort during search by moving bestmoves to front. (can be made easy with rootnode movepicker specialisation)
- try to reduce attr use, it's ugly.
