ideas for viri
MAJOR: 
- SMP
- tablebases
- docs
- type-safety overhaul

MINOR:
- update SearchInfo so that only one limit applies at once.
- tune search parameters
- tune move generation (check evasions?)
- learn SPRT
- check out other engine's impls of countermoves and killer moves
- replace all the false/true constgen stuff with a proper type.
- alpha pruning
- increase maxdepth just in case.
- fullwindow on big scores (+30?)
- capture history
- uci bench extension
- remove `as` casts and unsafe code
- use maths for MVVLVA instead of lookups
- things in hashkey: turn, rule50 / 8.
- perft divide
- preorder root nodes with eval, sort during search by moving bestmoves to front. (can be made easy with rootnode movepicker specialisation)
- try to reduce attr use, it's ugly.
- make FEN conversion not halt singlethreaded when writing to file. or generally.
- replace uses of iter().position() with a linear map type.
- more guards on mate scores (mostly for puzzlesolving)
- endgame material combination guarding. (see if SF has any good "winnability" tricks)
- optimise rep detection using https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/blob/f5a31b7e576e2e56825fcfdff75c739ed545e852/src/position.cpp#L874-L890
- "go mate X"
- fix currmovenumber bug
- the slow part of deduplication is the file I/O, consider mmap?.
- move evalparams and sparams into ThreadData.
- nullmove verification search
- record percentage of position where TT move saves movegen - similar for captures when we get staged movegen.
